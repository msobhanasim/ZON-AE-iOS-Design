The NI-payment-sdk-ios allows you to quickly integrate a payment checkout experience in your iOS app.

## Requirements

## Getting Started

### Integration

We support all the popular iOS dependency management tools. The SDK can be added via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

Head over to our [iOS Integration Docs](https://docs.ngenius-payments.com/reference#ios-sdk-integration-guide), which explain in detail the payment-sdk integration flow.
